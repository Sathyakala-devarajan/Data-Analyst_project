# Data-Analyst_project
Bikestore data analysis for Data analytics
        
OBJECTIVES:         
        In this portfolio consisting of an SQL Excel and Tableau project components all three of which are interrelated and based on the same data set. I will be following the five steps involved in all data analytics projects when putting together into this portfolio.
        First writing an SQL script to generate a detailed data set. 
        Next I am going to import the SQL generated data set into Excel and tableau.
In excel use pivot tables to generate a dynamic dashboard.
        I am going to connect the Excel data sheet that contains the SQL generated data set to Tableau and then generate the visually pleasing and dynamic dashboard.



PROCESS:
        Data analysis follows a demanding step-by-step process that involves as follows
        1. understanding the problem defining the business or project goals and laying out a plan to find a solution.
        2. Collecting and Gathering data from various sources based on set priorities.
        3. Cleaning the data to remove unwanted, redundant and missing values that may impede analysis
        4. Exploring and analyzing the data using business intelligence tools data visualization, data mining techniques and predictive modeling
        5. Interpreting the results to gain insights.



SQL:
        MySQL Database is used to get the meaningfull datas from raw data with scattered tables.
        For the first step, I need to analyse the database. Based on analysis, the management want to know the condition of the sales activities within
the company and gain insights into the various Trends happening in the sales volume over the 2016 to 2018 period. They also want to know the
revenues per region, per store, per product category and per brand, a list of the top customers and sales reps could also prove insightful. 
Their needs and goals are I need to figure out how to provide that information in the most organized and digestible way.

EXCEL or Tableau:
        I will create both an Excel and Tableau dashboard for this project. 
        Now I collected the dataset from google search. And it can be retrieved using SQL. 
        I need to write an SQL script that generates a data set with Fields consistent of the order ID, the customer's first and last name, the customer city and state, the order date, sales volume, Revenue, product name, product category, brand name, store name and sales rep.
        These fields are scattered across nearly nine separate but related tables in the bike stores database. So, I will need to perform a series of direct and indirect
table joints to generate the data set.
